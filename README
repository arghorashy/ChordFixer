- It would be nice to have something like a package for the model and each of its children, so I wouldn't need silly functions like ChordLines.newChordStanzaObject...
- The model should really be a virtual class: the class should not be instantiable (some of the functions need to be overridden for the class to work!).  Only children of the model class should be instantiable...  (Is instantiable a word???)
